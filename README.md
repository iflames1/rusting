# Learning Rust

Welcome to my Rust learning journey! 🚀

## What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that aims to provide the performance of C and C++ while preventing common programming errors. It's known for its focus on safety, speed, and concurrency.

## Why Rust?

- **Memory Safety:** Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety without sacrificing performance.

- **Concurrency:** Built-in support for concurrent programming, making it easier to write reliable, parallel code.

- **Zero-Cost Abstractions:** High-level abstractions without runtime overhead.

# Rust Variables

Welcome to the Rust Variables guide! ðŸ¦€

## Overview

In Rust, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They come with a set of rules and features that ensure memory safety and prevent common programming errors.

## Declaring Variables

Rust allows you to declare variables using the `let` keyword. Here's a basic example:

```rust
let x = 42; // Immutable variable
let mut y = 24; // Mutable variable
